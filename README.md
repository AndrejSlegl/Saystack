# Saystack

Saystack is a collection of simple classes and extensions for most common uses in any iOS Swift project. It is a Swift counterpart to [Haystack](https://github.com/legoless/Haystack). Saystack currently supports Swift 2.x. Swift 3.x version will be released once apps can be deployed to the App Store.

Saystack adds methods to multiple frameworks, including UIKit and Foundation.
